# Here I have uploaded an data analysis project done for one of my University course named Data Procurement. The project is about air pollution and acid rain analysis in NOrth rhine westphalia.The project includes different kind of cities in NRW. In this city the focus was on 5 elements like Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Nitrogen monoxide (NO), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), Particulate matter 10 (PM10) and Ozone (O3). As well as the exceedance of critical load of acidification due to Sulfur(S) and Nitrogen(N).

# Data source: The data of this elements from the different cities in NRW is collected from “Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz Nordrhein-Westfalen” the Year 2010 to 2019.
